# Introduction: Note Taker

## Instructions

Create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Motivation

```
My motivation was to create server side from scratch.
The client side was already build with HTML files and JS file also.
Working with express.js - library for HTTP methods(GET,POST,PUT,DELETE...) and server.
Demonastrate the collaboration Github(client side) and Heroku(server side).
Demonastrate how to work with Postamn - POST and DELETE request .

```

## Documentation

  * GET `/api/notes`: Shows all the notes from db.json file

  * POST `/api/notes` : POST request from server side with Postman

  * DELETE `/api/notes/:id` : DELETE request from server side with Postman
